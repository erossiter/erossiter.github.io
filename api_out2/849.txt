	"argument" : "I enjoy mostly indie bands as well as some old-school hip-hop & rock and roll. Recently, I've listened to rainbow kitten surprise, Jon Bellion, and Led-Zeppelin. I like hiking, going to see movies, and love seeing concerts. I missed the Joji concert a while ago and regret it. I like miso ramen, avocado toast, and watermelon smoothies. I tried playing piano this summer but I still kind of suck at it. "
