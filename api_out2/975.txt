	"argument" : "I love going fishing and listening to country music. I've been to two Luke Bryan concerts and listen to Morgan Wallen and Luke Combs like no one's business. My favorite food is buffalo fried chicken with fries, it is basically all I'll eat. Throughout high school and college what I'd do in my free time is go to baseball and football games. I grew up going to church every Sunday and Wednesday and spent more time there and in the gym than in my own house. People have definitely told my I have a country accent from time to time and that really boosted my ego."
