	"argument" : "The Biden Administration is having a disastrous immigration policy. On the Southern Mexico Border kids still are still separated from their parents after Trump separated them YEARS ago. Many of the disastourous Trump immigration policies are still in place. The asylum process is totally broken. Venezuelans trying to escape organized crime are being left in limbo for years when that's the antithesis of Asylum. It is great that the Biden administration is allowing Ukrainians into the country with a special immigration policy but the administration is completely ignoring all of our allies in Afghanistan that were left behind after the U.S. withdrawal. They have to go through the normal process. The only difference really seems to be that Ukrainians are European and Afghanis have darker skin. I give him credit for trying to repeal Title 42 even though the right-wing court struck it down."
