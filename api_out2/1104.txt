	"argument" : "Hello, I am a freshman at UNC. I am from Tennessee, and I love going to my family’s lake house on the weekend and fishing with my dad.  At UNC, it’s really fun to go to the football games with my friends and dress up for game days. With my new friends here, I like going on walks, listening to country music with them, going to church, getting dinner together, and hanging out at our sorority house."
