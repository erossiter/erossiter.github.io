	"argument" : "I believe that it is everyones constitutional right to  keep and bear arms. No matter what laws the government enforces on gun control, the bad guys are always going to find one way or another to get those guns that now Americans may not have because of the hash laws that have been passed. Yes I agree that laws should be passed and background checks should be in place before legally purchasing a gun to decrease the chance that it doesn't end up in the wrong hangs. But, if a criminal wants a gun, they will find a way to get it, which means that these laws should not make it impossible for Americans to purchase their guns. "
