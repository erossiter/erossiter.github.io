	"argument" : "Personally, Biden has had such a slow start. His term is coming to an end and he is just now making a name for himself. Regardless of political views and differences this is a fact everyone can agree one. Biden is honestly too old to be in office. The only thing I can remember Biden doing is making these gas prices extremely high and President Harris being in office while he was in surgery. His whole presidency was about rebuilding America the last president divided. After the morale went down he was been in office doing nothing, but at last he passed some bills. Biden is forgiving student loans, legalizing marijuana, and the gas prices are slowly but surely lowering. "
