	"argument" : "I am 18-years old and from Hickory, North Carolina. I enjoy working out and going to the gym. Exercising is one of my favorite things to do. I also enjoy watching and playing football for fun. I grew up a huge Panthers fan and love travelling to Charlotte for games (maybe not this year though, the Panthers aren't the best this season.) Uzi and 21 Savage are my favorite rappers. I'm always listening to their music. "
