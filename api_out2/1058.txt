	"argument" : "I'm a very outdoorsy person. My favorite activities are hiking, biking, and exploring the outdoors. My music taste is pretty eclectic. I typically listen to more alternative music like Billie Eilish and Phoebe Bridgers, but I also like old music from my parent's generation. I love to try new things so I don't know if I have a specific favorite food, but my favorite cuisine is definitely Mediterranean. "
