	"argument" : "The government regulating the right to bare arms is unconstitutional and should not be allowed. Gun control is an infringement on my rights as an American. The second amendment should be respected and protected. Not only that, but if I were to start a family I would want to be able to protect them. Most gun related deaths in the United States and suicides, not homicides. Liberals have twisted the story to try and get guns banned in States, creating the false narrative that guns are bad. "
