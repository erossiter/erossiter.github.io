	"argument" : "In my life religion doesn't play a large part of my life but it certainly plays a small part. I grew up in a family where my dads occupation is a Pastor of a United Methodist Church. I grew up going to church every Sunday, praying before meals, going to youth group, etc. However, as I've grown older I have questioned my beliefs and my values. I don't necessarily align myself with organized religion, but rather use my faith separately and personally. "
