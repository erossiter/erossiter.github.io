	"argument" : "President Biden receives a lot of scrutiny from the public. When the gas prices went up the public did not hesitate to claim that it was Biden's fault. The truth is, republicans will do anything in their power to make Biden sound terrible. With Biden implementing forgiveness of student loans, I believe this is a great decision. Biden is also trying to make opportunities for dreamers, this while having amazing results. Dreamers have immense potential and this should not go to waste just because they are not considered citizens. "
