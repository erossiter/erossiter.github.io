	"argument" : "In my free time I usually read books by authors like Margaret Atwood, Jane Austen, or Octavia E Butler. I have loved reading since  was a child and think it so special being able to lose yourself in a book. I also enjoy volunteering in my community garden or helping organize clothing at my thrift store. Recently I've tried to eat less meat and have been visiting a farmers markets near my house. My favorite food though would have to be pizza or black bean burgers. "
