	"argument" : "In my spare time, I love to listen to Broadway Musicals.  I also like watching foreign-language arthouse films.  As a vegetarian, I don't eat meat, so my favorite foods tend to be things like mushrooms and tofu if they're seasoned well.  My favorite movies are Black Panther and Captain Marvel, and my favorite book series is Harry Potter.  The music I listen to includes K-Pop and Taylor Swift."
