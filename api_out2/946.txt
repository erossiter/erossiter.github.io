	"argument" : "I am a strong believer in following the law. If every United States Citizens followed and abided by the law, we would have zero problems. I believe our legal system is put in place to protect everyone! I am planning on being a future attorney so I can demonstrate how effective the American Legal System is. People disrupted it, not the system itself. On my free time, I like to listen to gospel music and catch up on missed events. It is political season right now and I want to keep up with the polls. It is important we have someone with our core American values representing us to protect the American people. I love this country, the land opportunity and freedom, and I know I am going to be successful in it. "
