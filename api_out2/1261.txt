	"argument" : "Immigrants are an important part of the United States. The United States should be excited to have new people coming to the country ready to work and give their families a better life. I would love for there to be more legal access to the country. It would be great if instead of families having to wait months or years to get in that maybe only a month. By making the entry process smoother people can come to the United States without the Republican party fussing about illegal immigration. Once they get here we should be providing them with education and benefits to help them become stable citizens that can provide great ideas and benefit to the country. The country is/was built on immigrants coming for a better life from the Mayflower to Ellis island and there seem to be people who have forgotten that."
