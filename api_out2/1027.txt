	"argument" : "I am a Mexican-American who loves to play soccer, draw, and enjoy time with my friends. I love listening to Olivia Rodrigo, Bad Bunny, and Ariana Grande. My favorite foods are tacos and pizza. I put hot sauce on basically everything. I go to UNC-Chapel Hill, on a pre-law track to become an immigration attorney. I hope to advocate for the Hispanic Community. "
