	"argument" : "I grew up in Ayden, North Carolina which is a town of 6,000 people in rural eastern NC. I very much enjoy fishing and being outdoors, especially being on the water. I enjoy working with my dad on projects, and we've built quite a lot of things around our house. I drive a 4wd jeep specifically to be able to take offroad, I want my next vehicle to be a Duramax Silverado hopefully to be able to tow a future boat. My favorite food would probably be a medium rare rib eye, and my favorite drink is without a doubt sweet tea. I enjoy country music and classic rock, some of my favorite singers/bands are Tyler Childers, Koe Wetzel, Zach Bryan, Lynyrd Skynyrd, The Allman Brothers Band, and CCR. "
