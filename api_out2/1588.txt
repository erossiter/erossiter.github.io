	"argument" : "I believe religion is a very personal thing. I am religious and it solely affects my life and my won decisions. I am the person I am and I happy with who I am. As per my political advocation and implementation, I support all should be free to do what they please to do so if that be same-sex marriage or even the recreational use of marijuana. These are both examples of things in our culture that are not always accepted, which I do not always understand why considering the standpoint it would not affect the people by any means who are voting against it. Hence, my religion supports a strong ship and has showed me what it means to be true and fight for the freedom of other."
