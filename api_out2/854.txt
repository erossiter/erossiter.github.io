	"argument" : "Hello everyone! I grew up in Durham, North Carolina, and am 20 years old. I am majoring in sociology here at UNC, with a minor in public policy.  In my free time, I enjoy attending events on campus and visiting the local restaurants on Franklin Street (YoPo is my favorite). When in my dorm, I enjoy watching Netflix, sketching, and meditating. I sometimes listen to EDM music or rap while studying, depending on my mood.  "
