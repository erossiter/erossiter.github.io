	"argument" : "Gun control laws are not really the most effective at what they claim to achieve. Making something illegal does not stop the trafficking of said item. We can see this with the war on drugs and how it has not worked. Gun laws will not change whether people own guns. These laws will only restrict those who can have them. Those with the money or desire for harm will still be able to obtain these weapons and leave those unable to be in danger."
