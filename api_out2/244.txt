	"argument" : "President Biden is doing a good job in office. Joe Biden came into office during a very turbulent time in our country and has done a good job to get us back on track especially with the addition of millions of jobs. Also, I feel as though his student loan forgiveness plan will be wonderful for millions of Americans. Although he seems to have a low approval rating now, I think that this is just a rough patch he has hit and has been a great president! "
