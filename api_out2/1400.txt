	"argument" : "Governments have an obligation to take in immigrants. The opportunity  to move to a new place and better yourself shouldn't be withheld from anyone. The United States, markets itself as a land of opportunity, and yet we are limiting those who come in? No one is illegal. No one is an alien. We are all people trying to live. The U.S should make immigration easy, and attainable for all those who want to make it in the U.S."
