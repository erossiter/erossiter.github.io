	"argument" : "Religion is a major piece of my life. I grew up going to church every Sunday with my parents. Although college has not allowed me to make it to church every Sunday, I try my best. I joined my sororities bible study class and try to pray every night to remind myself how grateful I should be. I miss my church back home and I am excited to go back to it, Christmas mass is always my favorite. I downloaded an app on my phone that sends me a bible verse for the day and that has also helped me to feel a little bit at home with this big transition from high school to college.  "
