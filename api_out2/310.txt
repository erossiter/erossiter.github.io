	"argument" : "President Biden has been a very disappointing president. His performance on most if not all fronts has been unacceptable. From the moment he stepped in office and handled the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan to his passage of student debt forgiveness, it has been an ugly performance. Driving the nation's debt up to unprecedented levels and enabling extreme inflation for U.S. citizens has become an economic and political nightmare. Not to mention the immigration crisis we are currently dealing with at the nation's border. Not only are Biden's policies problematic but also hypocritical and detrimental to the people of this great nation.    "
