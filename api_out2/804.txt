	"argument" : "My favorite type of music is rap music, specifically I really like JID because he really focuses on real world issues. I am a huge sports fan with my favorite sport being basketball with football being a very close second. I've always lived in cities with great sports culture with growing up in Nashville and then moving to Chapel Hill when I was older. I'd say that my favorite food comes from the Turkish or Ethiopian cuisine. I'm very glad that as a child my family exposed me to many different types of food because without my ability to do that I may have never found some of my favorite foods. "
