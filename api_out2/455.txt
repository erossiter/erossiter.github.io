	"argument" : "Gun control laws are needed. Not everyone needs to have access to a gun. My view on gun control laws is that they need be realistic and wary of the people that want guns. I think that it is crucial to keep the testing before getting a gun and keep making a license required for the safety of citizens. Guns bring unnecessary violence and fear into people, and gun control laws can ensure that the people who have guns are qualified and safe enough to carry or have one.  "
