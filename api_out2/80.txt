	"argument" : "President Biden's performance in office thus far has not brought about the change that many thought. He hasn't made any drastic decisions that would positively impact. There were some negative events that has happened in his time in office which do not reflect well on him. Personally, I don't know how he's doing because anything that he may have done has not impacted me. I hoped for more from him, but right now he is falling short of the change America needed. "
