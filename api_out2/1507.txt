	"argument" : "Immigration is bad for our country. People should go back to where they are from because they are taking jobs from hard working Americans. My brothers in the Army should be able to come home to jobs and not have to be on the streets because when he went to serve, when the immigrants took his job. My family, we are hard working Americans, we pull up our bootstraps and go to work, while immigrants live off our taxes and steal our jobs. We need to make our immigration policies more strict. Especially since some of these immigrants are terrorists, the same ones who were fighting us in the middle east. We NEED to protect the good people of America.  "
