	"argument" : "Religion to me is a scam. Growing up I was forced to go to church and participate in Sunday school almost every weekend but I have never believed in god and identify as an Agnostic. I think religion is a tool used to push homophobia and the patriarchy onto young children and I see no difference between religion and a cult other than religions not having the same social stigma as cults."
