	"argument" : "I play a lot of sports. Primarily soccer and golf. I'm not the best at either, but I like to think I'm pretty good. I also do a lot of working out/going to the gym and things like that. I like exercising and working on myself, I think it's really healthy and good for both mental and physical. I don't listen to a lot of music, but when I do it's usually rap or just top hits. I really like Mexican food. I eat a lot of Chipotle. I know is not authentic, but it's pretty good. "
