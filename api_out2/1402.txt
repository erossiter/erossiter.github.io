	"argument" : "The United States is, and always has been, stolen land. This country has worked since its conception to be more advanced and progressive than the rest. Therefore, to many, the U.S. is a safe place and beacon of hope. That is what this country was to those being rejected from or oppressed by Great Britain's tyranny back in the 1700s. Just because the U.S. is now an established super power, doesn't mean that it should cease being a welcome place for those experiencing the same struggles as former Americans."
