	"argument" : "My favorite thing to do when I first wake up is to have time to journal and clear my thoughts. It helps me to focus before I begin the long day ahead of me. I enjoy listening to Cavetown and Billie Eilish. I love to go hiking, especially during sunset. I love reading books of all kinds but I really love reading historical fiction. I enjoy how the history and the facts are usually accurate but also how the fiction adds to the personal aspect of the story."
