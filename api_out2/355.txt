	"argument" : "Joe Biden's performance as President has been absolutely awful. Biden is one of the most illegitimate Presidents we have ever had. He has done nothing he promised he would when he was running for President. Political debate has always been a problem in our nation. Ever since Joe Biden became President, I feel that it has dramatically increased. Yet, he has done nothing about it. "
