	"argument" : "I believe there is not a problem with responsible gun ownership. The problem in this country stems from not enough restrictions placed on dangerous individuals obtaining weapons designed for mass murder. There is no reason incidents like Sandy Hook and Uvalde should ever have taken place. It is abhorrent and a national embarrassment that we are the only nation on earth that has this problem. I think the best course of action are red flag laws and background checks, as well as bans on assault weapons. I believe that any responsible gun owner should be fine with these laws and the people who are opposed to them probably shouldn't own a gun in the first place. "
