	"argument" : "I like listening to rap and R&B music. I enjoy going to sporting events, playing sports, and just spending time with the people I love. My dad is a chef so my food taste varies. I love all types of seafood, I am also a big steak girl, I like trying different plays on beef and pork, but I will always love home-cooked southern cooking."
