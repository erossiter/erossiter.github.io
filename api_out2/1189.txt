	"argument" : "I'm a 20 year old from Virginia, but I attend school in North Carolina. I enjoy going to tailgates and college football games on Saturdays and watching NFL football all day Sunday. I listen to country music a lot, but also enjoy rap and some pop. I could always go for a good hamburger or hotdog, but I also love mexican food. I hunt a bit as well, but only with my dad and brothers. "
