	"argument" : "I find myself to be a typical or rather normal person. I enjoy playing and watching baseball, I listen to a variety of music (normally rap/hip-hop, but I also enjoy country/folk music quite a lot), I'm not really much of a picky eater and I tend to be open to trying new foods. I am a big family person, we spend a lot of time together and go to events/trips together. I am religious and try to make it to church as often as I can, but that doesn't always happen. It's also a tradition for my family to go hunting around the same time every year."
