	"argument" : "I use religion as a guiding light, but I do not rely on every word I read as law. There are different interpretations for almost every section that we read and hear and I think it is important for someone who is of true faith to take their religion and faith into their own hands and to blindly agree to whatever they are told. Free thought and critical thinking about one's beliefs encourages understanding. "
