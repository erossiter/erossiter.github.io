	"argument" : "Religion honestly doesn’t play a role in my life at all. Growing up, my parents didn’t really bring me and my brother to church; we would only go sometimes on Easter or Christmas. They wanted us to have the freedom to choose what we believed, and I really chose to not have it be a big part of my life at all. I think it’s an interesting concept, but religion has nothing to do with what I believe politically or morally, and I don’t think it should (politically, at least). "
