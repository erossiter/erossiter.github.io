	"argument" : "Gun control laws are a necessary part of protecting society. With the years of gun violence we have seen in the world the fight to demand gun control is still going on. Guns are a huge problem in society and they are too easily accessed. Laws, regulations, and restrictions need to be implemented by the courts. Guns are causing harm to people everywhere. The courts are constantly receiving push back on the gun control debate because of its connection to the 2nd amendment. Tragedies and gun violence are constant occurring, when will we finally say enough is enough? Will we be forced to witness another Sandy Hook tragedy? Another Columbine massacre? Guns are a danger to society and without regulations and laws we will continue to repeat the past. "
