	"argument" : "I support legal immigration but leaving our country open to millions of illegal and undocumented immigrants burdens our established systems and leaves our country vulnerable. America accepts more legal immigrants every year than any other country in the world. It should be that way, immigration is a good thing; however, illegal immigration is not. In the short run, it may not seem like a big deal because we are such an affluent country but exacerbated over decades, it begins to pose more and more problems. The U.S. should prioritize its own interests by keeping a secure border. "
