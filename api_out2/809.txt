	"argument" : "Two of my favorite hobbies is going on hikes and playing soccer. I also love to go shopping, especially thrifting! I love pop music and my favorite artist is Taylor Swift. My favorite foods are Mexican and Japanese food but I always love to try new restaurants as well! I also love coffee so you could probably find me studying at different cafes. "
