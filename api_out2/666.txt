Why would we make an amendment on bearing arms if we thought it was wrong? A gun doesn’t kill people, people kill people. Assuming that owning a gun is the reasoning people are dying is ridiculous. We live in a world where it isn’t safe to walk in the streets alone, having a registered hand gun will provide the safety that most Americans seek for in this day and age. "
