	"argument" : "In terms of gun control laws I tend to differ back to the 2nd amendment. It is a right of the American people and especially in terms of what is happening in America today having your own access to guns can keep you protected from those who abuse the power. At this point taking away the people's right to firearms is only hurting the law abiding citizens that would follow the new terms."
