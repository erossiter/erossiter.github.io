	"argument" : "Biden's performance in office so far has not surprised me. He ran a campaign based on insulting former President Trump and making, thus far, false promises. He has definitely been a less polarizing President in comparison to President Trump in terms of things he's said and done while in office. However, this is also because he has hardly done anything. The only things most people could easily attribute as being features of Biden's America would be record high gas prices and the cancelling of student loan debts that many Americans didn't even ask for.
