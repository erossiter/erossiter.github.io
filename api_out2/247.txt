	"argument" : "President Biden is not the best president, however he is the blessing that this country needed. The biggest immediate turnaround was a sense of professionalism and empathy. He knows how to actually care about the needs of people in this country who have been forgotten and has tried to make amends for mistakes we have made in the past. For Biden, which I don't mind, he has prioritized social policies over economic policies. It's so often that this country becomes so concerned with money and forgets about the important things in life like being a decent human. Economically, I hope that he continues attempting to make larger corporations accountable for their business practices. "
