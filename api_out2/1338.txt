	"argument" : "I believe everyone should get to experience this great country, if done so properly. By, properly you need to go through the immigration process before you can do anything in this country. It is our job as Americans to keep America safe,  but we must do so properly. We can not allow invaders to come in and take our jobs, houses, and opportunities. Immigrants are welcomed as long as they are naturalized. Our natural and naturalized citizens should experience all the same benefits, but not the invaders. We need a stronger immigration policy. It is tearing our party apart when it could all be so simple. Our U.S government needs to come up with an effective plan that will properly allow certain immigrants while keeping other out, who might be a threat to this great nation. "
