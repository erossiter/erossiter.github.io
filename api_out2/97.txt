	"argument" : "President Biden is probably in the bottom ten worst Presidents we've had. For starters he cannot speak coherently when he is on the podium and is a horrible communicator. He seems like he is being told what to do instead of taking action on anything and I do not trust a man who fell asleep while talking to the Pope to be in command of the armed forces, AT ALL. He gets credit for rolling out the COVID vaccine however Trump was the one who funded it and produced it, and even after that he managed to screw up the COVID pandemic again with the delta, and omicron variants so that even after we got vaccinated we still had to wear masks and go into another minor lockdown. Joe Biden shouldn't have won the election originally due to voter fraud and he shouldn't be the President next term."
