	"argument" : "I grew up religious (Christian), but around 14 my parents began to let me choose how involved I wanted to be. I haven't been to church in probably 3 years and before that I only went for Easter and Christmas. I pride myself on my logical thinking and because of that I don't think I can reasonably believe in what Christian thought defines God as. With all that being said, I do want to believe in a higher power, I just haven't quite figured out how I see everything working. Additionally, I don't judge anyone who is religious, in fact I envy them a bit â€“ I wish I could have that faith in something. "
