	"argument" : "I believe that President Biden has done as well as he could have with the state of America that he was handed following Donald Trump's administration. In 2022 we were offered two less-than-optimal choices and President Biden was the more appropriate choice. He had a lot of big goals going into office and I can tell that he is truly working towards these. For example, he just put out a pardon on marijuana charges and is working towards decriminalizing marijuana. There is certainly more change needed in America, but we cannot expect one president to get it all done. "
