	"argument" : "Everyone has a right to bare arms as stated in the Constitutional Bill of Rights. Therefore, the government doesn't have a say on my individual right. Guns don't kill people, people kill people and by making guns illegal it wont make it go away, it'll just make it harder for the people who know how to use them and take care of them to get them! Guns will just end up on the black market to be sold illegally because the people who use guns to kill people are criminals! "
