	"argument" : "I am a college student in a large public university. I enjoy playing sports, especially basketball and volleyball, and I like to watch soccer as well. I like to listen to mainly pop artists, such as Taylor Swift and Lil Nas X, although I do also like to listen to Green Day. My favorite food to eat would be arroz a la cubana, a dish my parents would feed me growing up. I recently have started drinking boba and I really like it as well."
