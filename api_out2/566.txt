	"argument" : "Gun control laws have become a lot to handle and understand. I support background checks, but also think that many have the idea that strict gun control laws are going to prevent mass shootings. At the end of the day, if someone wants to do something horrible, they will find a way to obtain a gun and carry out that action. Additionally, at some point the government can only have so much control before they are controlling every aspect of life. I think limited gun control can help, but doesn't eradicate issues that those making the  laws are fearing. "
