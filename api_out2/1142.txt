	"argument" : "I am a college student from Kentucky and I love to hunt. My favorite book is 1984 and I read almost every day. I love Fried Chicken (Not KFC). When I lived in Kentucky my favorite thing to do with my friends was going to the Walmart parking lots for truck meets and hanging out. I have a lifted Ford F150 with a camp wrap."
