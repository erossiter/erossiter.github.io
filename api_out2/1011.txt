	"argument" : "I enjoy being outside in nature (hiking, mountain biking, going to the beach) and doing creative projects (painting, drawing, sewing). I enjoy many different genres of music, specifically indie, 70s music, and Taylor Swift. I generally go for healthier foods like salads and rice bowls, but I also like the occasional burger or slice of pizza. "
