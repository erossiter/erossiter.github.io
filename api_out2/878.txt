	"argument" : "I am a person of many flavors. For music, I like indie rock, blues, jazz, and pop. I live in a big family of myself and four sisters. I really like to eat Indian food as I find them delicious. I travel a lot: I've been to China, Greece. Mexico, Japan, Thailand, and many states in the United States. Also, my favorite music band is BTS."
