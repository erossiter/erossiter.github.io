	"argument" : "My favorite hobby is hunting. I love it and do it all the time with my friends. I have 2 12 gauge shot guns, a sniper rifle, and a bow which I use to shoot deer and ducks. My favorite music genre is country and I love to listen to Luke Bryan. I also love football and my favorite team is the Alabama Crimson Tide, ROLL TIDE! My favorite food is a good old fashioned American hamburger with a side of french fries. My favorite holidays are the Fourth of July and Christmas, and I love to drive down the highway with my windows down blasting country music. My favorite movie is Top Gun and my second favorite is American Sniper."
