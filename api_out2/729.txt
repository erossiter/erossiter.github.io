	"argument" : "I am a strong supporter of the second amendment and of gun rights in America. My family are all gun owners and will be getting my concealed carry permit as soon as I turn 21, as well as having guns passed down to me at the same time. I am fine with background check laws, red flag laws, and would even be okay with mandatory gun safety laws, but I in no way support the banning of guns, including assault rifles like the AR-15 platform. I actually plan to eventually purchase an AR-15, probably a .223 Remington, as it's a very versatile weapon, and in my opinion one of the best home defense weapons. "
