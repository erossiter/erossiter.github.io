	"argument" : "Since third grade, I've been in love with football and played it all the way through to college. I tend to listen to rap and country, but I'm usually good with any type of music. Growing up in North Carolina, my dad was a huge barbecue fan, so that's always been my favorite food. Other than that, I played the trumpet in high school, love hunting, and played lacrosse for a couple years."
