	"argument" : "I grew up in a small town called Dallas, North Carolina. I started raising steer for 4-H when I was in the fourth grade and I loved it. It taught me the value of hard work and how to manage my money. Now I still enjoy animals, goats will always be my favorite. I like classic rock and country and I love CrossFit. I like to spend time outside whenever I can, I enjoy hiking and gardening. I also love baking, which might be my favorite, but I also really enjoy a night in, hanging with my friends and family. My favorite food is probably mac and cheese.  "
