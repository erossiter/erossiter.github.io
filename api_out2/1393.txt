	"argument" : "Immigration is a non-issue. America is supposed to be the land of the free and thus should be open to anyone willing to enter the United States, even if the manner in which they enter is brutal and messy. Instead of villainizing Mexicans trying to cross the border into the U.S., as a bastion of freedom the U.S. should be responsible for aiding them and granting them relief. Thus, illegal immigration wouldn't even be necessary. "
