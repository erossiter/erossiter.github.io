	"argument" : "President Biden's been in office for less than two years and has already done far more damage than the general public could have ever imagined. His quick withdrawal from Afghanistan showed us how much interest President Biden shows in the protection of The American Military and the people they put their life on the line to defend. Should we have retreated from Afghanistan? Absolutely. However, The Biden Administration showed a tremendous lack of care, strategy, and general thought when pulling troops from Afghanistan. That was mistake number one in the Biden Presidency, and since we have seen nothing but a snowball effect into horrible politics and policies. We have seen the market skyrocket, a lack of jobs resulting in high of unemployment rates, gas prices sky rocket, and many, many false promises that have yet to be fulfilled such as loan forgiveness, among many others.
