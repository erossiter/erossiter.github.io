	"argument" : "Religion hasn't been something I've grown up in. I see myself as a spiritual person and believe in God. I see church as a place of gossip rather than a place that worships in Christ. The churches I have been to have very judgmental people and it makes me feel unwanted. Although I have not had the best experience with church, I am loved by Christ. "
