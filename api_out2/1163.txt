	"argument" : "I like to play basketball. I played in high school and it's how I spent most of my free time growing up. I'm from a small town of about 8000 people, but I want to move back there after college. My favorite song right now is Stay by Post Malone. I'm a big J. Cole fan and I was in the top .1% of listeners last year. My favorite fast-food chain is Cook-Out. "
