	"argument" : "Well, to begin with, I very much enjoy music. I've been playing instruments since I was young and have continued to appreciate the beauty and theory of music. I've taken many music classes and have participated in many bands and orchestras, so this is very important to me. I have mastered the trumpet and my main genre of performance is classical, jazz, Brazilian bossa nova, and traditional Latin salsa. The performing arts is something I've always been drawn to, although, it is not my major at UNC.  I am currently and Communication and Psychology major and plan to become a psychiatrist with specializations in geriatrics, adolescents, and addiction. I am very passionate about the work I plan to do as well as the breadth of my anticipated field. I feel as though the work we do is important and life-changing. My sister, a mental health clinician at Rutgers University, inspired me to walk this path.  My favorite food is Chipotle. "
