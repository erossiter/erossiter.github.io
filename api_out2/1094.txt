	"argument" : "I am from a small town and I enjoy listening to country music, fishing, and hunting. I love to drink sweet tea with fried chicken, and ride horses in my spare time. I also enjoy watching football and NASCAR. Family, Faith, and Country are the three biggest aspects of my identity, and are the principles I carry with me every day. I believe in hard work, and especially the work done with your hands, I live in my boots and never go anywhere without a hat of some kind."
