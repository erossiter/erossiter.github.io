	"argument" : "Gun control is an inherent violation of constitutional rights. Every person has the right to defend themselves and bear arms, and those trying to take that away through gun control laws are acting unconstitutionally. I believe that if they take away our second amendment rights, they will then come after more and more fundamental rights. Personally, I believe it should be much easier to acquire a firearm in order to protect yourself than it currently is. Gun control laws would do the opposite! It is an outrageous violation and no gun control laws should ever be passed."
