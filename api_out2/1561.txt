Extensive research proves that first-generation immigrants hurt the economy because they require more money from the federal government than native-born citizens. Furthermore, they also hurt the economy by depriving the lower-skilled U.S. citizens of every chance to make it into the workforce because these immigrants arrive in the U.S. for cheap and work for cheap as opposed to the lower-skilled U.S. citizen who won't accept a severely low wage.

It isn't fair that they can walk in here so easily, then deprive U.S. citizens of necessities. I do support work visas though. They come, they work, and then they leave so that our workers can make it into the workforce. Refugees are another topic..."
