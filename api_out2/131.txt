	"argument" : "I think President Biden is a failure of a president. I think that he never should have been elected anyways since he stole the election but since our government is corrupt, he was allowed to steal the office from President Trump. President Biden is the reason inflation is so out of control and gas prices are so high. His administration is undoing all of the excellent work President Trump did to make this country great again."
