	"argument" : "I enjoy hanging out with friends, especially those from back home. I only live 2 hours away from home so it is not to bad. Usually, I like to to go shopping, get my hair, toes and nails done. I love to pamper myself. Also, throughout the schooldays I either listen to country and rap music, depends on what kind of mood that I am in. Mainly, my favorite food would have to be home cooked Southern style meals, sushi and Italian food as well. "
