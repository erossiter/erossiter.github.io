	"argument" : "When it comes to gun control one must understand the second amendment, the right to bear arms. Many who's views fall under program feel that the constitution gave them the right to bear arms. Personally my view is that the second amendment does not apply to modern day life. The amendment was formed to allow militias to overthrow a corrupt government. This no longer applies because the government has grown too big to overthrow. Therefor the 2nd amendment should become null."
