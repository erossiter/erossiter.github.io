	"argument" : "Here's the thing, I feel that people voted for Biden in the way that they did simply because he wasn't Trump. It was like picking the better of the two evils. In my opinion, I feel that the options last election weren't the best, but Biden needed to win because the social climate of this country would've continued to decline if Trump had won re-election. As for his performance, I would say he's doing alright. In all honesty, I haven't completely caught up with everything to speak on this more, but all I will say is that more seems like it would be done if Republicans would stop halting bills and overturning laws like Roe v. Wade. It's almost like trying to drive a car forward but also in reverse. "
