	"argument" : "I love watching movies â€“ especially the old ones. Modern Hollywood has ruined the art of cinema. There's something so satisfying about being able to look at a classic like Gone with the Wind or Casablanca that wasn't pressured into a political message by the studios. I also really like playing video games, especially shooters, and social media."
