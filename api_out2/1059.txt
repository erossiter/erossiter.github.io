	"argument" : "I enjoy listening to music a lot, as well as attempting to make music. I like peach pit and backseat lovers, which are both indie rock bands. I love meeting people and trying and make as many friends as I can. I try and make friends with people who have seen other sides of life than I so that I can further increase my worldview. I also try and eat from restaurants that source their food from humane places, even if it costs more for me because the environment is more important to me than my wallet. "
