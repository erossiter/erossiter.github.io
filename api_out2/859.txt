	"argument" : "One of my main hobbies includes photography. I love capturing small moments in time and keeping them like a little time capsule, and I absolutely love taking sports photography. I also love reading; I spend time reading at least for an hour a day. Movies and tv shows are a big joy for me (specifically things like the MCU) and I especially enjoy analyzing them; there’s so many cool aspects hidden under the surface. I love all kinds of music, I’ll honestly listen to anything, but I specifically love the group BTS. "
