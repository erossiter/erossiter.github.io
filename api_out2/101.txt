	"argument" : "God where do I start, President Biden has managed to achieve the opposite of progress since his time in office began. Total inflation is up as much as 30% in parts of the United States. His weak leadership has allowed Russia to invade Ukraine, violating UN treaties without any sort of punishment. Illegal immigration is out of control, gas prices have skyrocketed from $2~ per gallon to around $4 per gallon in the United States thanks to President Biden's closing of the Keystone XL pipeline. President Biden's stint has done nothing but harm Americans and send our economy spiraling towards a recession. This is all said without mentioning that 190% more Covid-19 deaths have occurred under President Biden than his predecessors time in office. "
