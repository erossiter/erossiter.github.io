	"argument" : "President Biden so far in office has really done a fine job, but he's not done an excellent job. He is much more preferable compared to the Trump regime because Biden actually stands for standards that uphold democracy, which is something that Trump did not do when he contested the results of a free and fair election. I'd say that he could be doing a lot more at the moment to help the needy people in our country after such a hard time, but he is still better than Trump. Joe Biden hasn't done bad things, but I just feel that he has not done enough at this point in time. "
