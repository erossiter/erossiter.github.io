	"argument" : "I'm the type of person who loves sports, so I enjoy playing basketball, football, or even sports that I'm not so good at, in my free time. I also love music, so I listen to a wide variety of genres, but mostly Rap, Pop, and R&B. Lastly, I'm always open to trying new foods, so some of my favorites are foreign foods, like Chinese, Italian, and Hispanic."
