	"argument" : "Religion does not play a role in my life, however, I do recognize that there is something larger than me in this world. I find that not religious beliefs, but organized religion is becoming a threat and leaking into our political system. Religion and State should be two separate policies, but as we have seen with the newest ruling on Roe v Wade and the views on homosexuals in this country, I cannot outright support an organized religion. I hold my own beliefs close to me, but will never try to force those on others.  "
