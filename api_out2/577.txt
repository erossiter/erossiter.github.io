	"argument" : "Personally, I do not understand why gun control has become a partisan issue in the first issue. When innocent children are being slaughtered in our schools thanks to demonstrably relaxed gun restrictions, it should be obvious that guns should be restricted. Republicans like to claim that guns have various practical uses such as hunting and self-defense. Though this is quite the ridiculous assertion as such activities do not necessitate a fully automatic rifle. Despite this, Republicans insist upon adhering to the drivel given to them by mass manipulators such as Tucker Carlson. "
