He handled the pandemic well, making free vaccines and boosters available, and it was under his leadership that it finally came to an end.  He signed a student loan forgiveness plan that will change the lives of millions of Americans, as well as significant gun legislation in the aftermath of the Uvalde shooting. He's addressed global warming by approving significant environmental projects. Biden also signed the Inflation Reduction Act as well as the infrastructure law in the wake of economic unrest this past year. Finally, he's helped make healthcare for veterans more affordable. Overall, I approve of Biden for actually making significant progress, and doing so with integrity and transparency. "
