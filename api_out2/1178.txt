	"argument" : "I love the outdoors and participating in sports in order to relax on a regular basis. I play tennis pretty regularly and love hiking, fishing, and camping. I value the feeling you get when you are out there alone in the woods and it is what I miss most here at Chapel Hill. My favorite food often depends but I feel that my favorite meal is something my grandma makes well: steak, green beans and corn, yeast rolls, and some cheesecake. "
