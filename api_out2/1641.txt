	"argument" : "Religion does not have a place in government. The government should not discriminate against people because of their religious beliefs or lack thereof. Public Schools should not be allowed to teach religions or have mandated prayers because not everyone believes the same thing. People are free to practice their own religion, but a public place where other people may be made uncomfortable by it is not the right place. Also government should not be able to make any laws regulating or regarding people's religion.  "
