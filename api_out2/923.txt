	"argument" : "I am from Davidson county, North Carolina. In my youth I did boyscouts and played football on my local high school team. I enjoy playing golf in my free time and going fishing with my father and grandfather. When I go home for the summer I take time to see my family weekly on Sunday nights after church and try to learn as much as I can in my grandfather's garage where he works as an auto detailer.  "
