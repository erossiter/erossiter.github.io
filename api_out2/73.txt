Joe Biden, given what he has, has always been on the side of the American people. Biden has helped women fight against their rights being taken away, while also mass producing vaccines to help us survive this ongoing pandemic. President Biden has had his flaws, especially in terms of inflation. Prices going up and the stock market going down has not helped this country at all. However, the President does not fully control this economy, but he is not helping it either. Even with Biden's economic flaws, there is an obvious improvement in social justice issues and it feels like Covid is slowly going away, thanks to his vaccine mandates. President Biden, working with what Trump gave him, is improving this country as it recovers from before. "
