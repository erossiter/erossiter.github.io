	"argument" : "Hobbies, music, and food are a big part of my life. I find my mental health is best when I am outside. I enjoy being outdoors and within nature. My favorite hobbies are to play gulf and tennis. My favorite music is a variety of genres such as the Beatles, Rihanna, Lady Gaga, Bob Marley and so much more. I truly enjoy a mix of every genre, but not so much country. Food is a huge part of culture everywhere. I enjoy a variety of food including veggie burgers, avocado salads, and burritos. Food is our fuel and what we put into our bodies matters, healthy foods such as fruit salads, and avoiding eating too much meat is important. For a time I even thought about going vegetarian after hearing the treatment animals are put through at slaughter houses and the inhuman treatment. "
