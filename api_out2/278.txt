	"argument" : "Joe Biden has been absolutely terrible in office so far. Nothing that he has done has made sense in the slightest. He has drained our oil reserves in order to get gas prices under control instead of repealing the idiotic acts he has passed against the oil industries. He is also going to drag us into WWIII by giving billions of taxpayers' money to Ukraine while also blowing up the Nord Pipeline. We are so screwed with him in office. Lets Go Brandon."
