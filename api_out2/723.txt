	"argument" : "What I can never really understand is people restricting one's right to protect themselves. I understand that giving people more access to guns may make it more likely for guns to fall into the wrong hands, but how better should people be protecting themselves from these kind of people? Since the majority of gun owners are using them for protection or hobbies like hunting, I feel like people should continue being allowed to have them. Background checks are fine, but extensive waiting periods are unnecessary and keep people from something they should have access to. "
