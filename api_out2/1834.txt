	"argument" : "I was born, raised, and confirmed as a Catholic but no longer practice. I believe in a lot of the morals of the church. Love thy neighbor and don't steal. There are a lot of genuinely really good morals but the politicization and pedophilia of the church that pushed me away. Before Ronald Reagan the church did a lot of really cool social advocacy but he radicalized it as an evangelical weapon. The church did not have a stance on abortion before this time. It did not advocate so heavily against gay marriage. All of these things make it so morally untenable as an entity that I let influence my life. I think the church needs to be separated from state because as a human organization it can be corrupted and weaponized by bad actors. I like the most recent pope a lot though."
