	"argument" : "Biden seems like a puppet. There are several things he seems to have done just so he can 'say' that he did something in office. When he wanted to remove those federally imprisoned on cannabis charges, it didn't release a single person, furthermore, his proposed budget spending plan at the beginning of his term was not favorable to me. I did not like his plan to increase taxes on the wealthy. They would be required to pay 20% in taxes which is unfair considering that the middle class pays around 8.2%. That, coupled with the lack of addressing national inflation, makes his economic plan leave a sour taste in my mouth. In the long run, he is only doing these things to try and be a 'people pleaser' and he's failed at that, at least in my opinion. "
