	"argument" : "I believe that immigration in the United States should be banned. The U.S. does not benefit by having illegal aliens invade the areas that the founding fathers established in North America. Also, allowing immigration only contributes to higher crime rates, such as through drug abuse, rape, and theft. If a wall is built between the United States and Mexico, the illegals would cease bringing their issues to the great country of America. Allowing immigrants from Africa and South America should be limited, if not terminated in totality, because of the many problems those people bring. Contrarily, immigrants from Europe should be the only immigrants allowed to relocate to countries because of the opportunities that the Europeans bring.  "
