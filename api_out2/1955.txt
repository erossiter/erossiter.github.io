	"argument" : "I grew up going to church with my family. We pray before every meal, before we travel long distances, when a relative is feeling sick, during funerals, during weddings, during baby showers, before/during/after tests, job interviews, birthdays. It doesnâ€™t matter the occasion. We even praise the Lord just to say thank you for being alive. For me, religion is a part of every day life."
