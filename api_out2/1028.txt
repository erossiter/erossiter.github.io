	"argument" : "I'm from Washington, D.C. and I went to Georgetown Day School with Associate Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's daughter, Leila. I played lacrosse, and my favorite games were against Sidwell Friends School, because I got to play with Masie Biden and Sasha Obama. I admire their parents greatly.
