	"argument" : "I am from Atlanta, Georgia but funny enough I am an Alabama fan. I have a big love of sports, especially College football. I'm a big fan of hiking, and camping and love going out in nature with my family. I'm a big family guy so anything surrounding them is my ideal day. My favorite music would is Classical sometimes Modern and occasionally Country. My favorite Food is Pasta."
