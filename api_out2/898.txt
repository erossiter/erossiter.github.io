	"argument" : "I enjoy watching all sports, with my favorite sports being football and basketball, although I wish sports were how they used to be. Outside of watching sports I also like to play them, any time I can get together with my friends we all try to find time to play together. I enjoy listening to all kinds of music; my favorite genre is hip-hop/rap. I would say that I enjoy all types of foods but Mexican food has always been my favorite."
