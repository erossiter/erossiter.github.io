	"argument" : "Gun control take away from my first amendment right. But more importantly it takes away from me being able to protect my family. Say I was being robbed at home, I should be allowed to have a gun to protect my home and my family. Hand held gun, shot gun, all guns should be allowed. I'm not saying people with mental issues should or can have guns but I am saying there is nothing stopping them. So if they come to my home. I need to protect myself, my home and my family. Gun control takes away from my right and its not right. "
