	"argument" : "Religion plays a large part in my life, I was raised in the church, and I feel like a huge part of who I am and my moral compass is centered around the church. I believe that people's lives would be a lot better if they were also involved in the church and Christianity. I was baptized as a child and will raise my children in the church as well. I think it's important to spread the word of Christ, and that means making it centered in my family, personality, and relationships in general. My everyday goal is to be more like Christ. "
