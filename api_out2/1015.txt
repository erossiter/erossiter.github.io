	"argument" : "My hobbies include reading, listening to music, participating in social service activities, meditating, spending time in nature, and talking with friends and family. I enjoy all kinds of music such as pop, rock, indie and since I'm Hispanic I also like listening to various Spanish-speaking artists too. I like trying foods from different cultures, I would say my favorites are sushi and ceviche (traditional Peruvian plate). "
