	"argument" : "I was born in a small town in North Carolina which definitely shaped who I am. I love driving around on the back roads listening to my favorite songs on high to keep me busy. Although most people think that I would be a country fan I actually prefer rocking out to rap. My country side does come out in regards to my favorite foods and I am a sucker for bbq sandwiches, corn bread, and will wash it down with a cool glass of cheerwine."
