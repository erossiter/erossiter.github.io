	"argument" : "Religion is the most important aspect of my life. In everything I do, I try to put the Lord first. Because of this, religion is the foundation of many of my beliefs and influences how I act. I try to follow His word and I think that religion should be respected and listened to more. I believe that if more people followed God, we would live in a better world."
