	"argument" : "My hobbies are playing baseball, going to the gym, spending time with my family, hiking, and hunting. I especially enjoy hunting during this time of year as most of the deer and bunnies are out looking for food before the winter so you see many more than usual. My favorite type of music is country as I am from Pigeon Forge, Tennessee and I grew up listening to country all the time. My father taught me how to play the guitar when I was young and I was in a country band as a child before I moved to NC. My favorite food is anything that has steak because I love some good steak and pork foods. "
