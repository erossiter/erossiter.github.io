	"argument" : "President Biden's job as president has been rough to say the least. Overall, the economy has completely collapsed falling to new lows. Additionally, his government handouts as a whole have been horrific. All he has managed to do is raise inflation. Finally, President Biden's handling of the Covid situation has been disastrous. His policy on masking was just a political fiasco to win an election, and once he had won, he only masked in front of the public. Joe Biden has been a very poor president. "
