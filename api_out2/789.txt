	"argument" : "I enjoy hiking and playing guitar. I currently love listening to Phoebe Bridgers and Steve Lacy, who I am going to see in concert soon this November. I'm a huge fan of peaches, so recently I have been making peach-related deserts such as scones and pie. I've also been into making kombucha recently (since I finally found a SCOBY to use) and got to make peach kombucha which turned out great."
