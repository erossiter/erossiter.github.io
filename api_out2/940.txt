	"argument" : "I grew up in the country so I really enjoy spending time outdoors- especially in the fall. When I can I love to go back home and go hunting with my Dad and try to get a good deer to make some jerky out of. Here in Chapel Hill I am deeply involved with my local church and lead a student worship group on Wednesdays."
