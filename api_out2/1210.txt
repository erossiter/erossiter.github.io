	"argument" : "I do not see a problem with increasing opportunities for immigrants to legally enter the states. I think policies like DACA are what we need to give immigrants opportunities to establish themselves here. People claim that immigrants are taking our jobs but a stronger argument is that they do the jobs most already donâ€™t want to do. The United States of America is a country of immigrants, there is an inherent duty to welcome them now. Additionally, as an economically advanced country, we have a certain moral obligation to provide assistance to people that need it."
