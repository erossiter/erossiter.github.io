	"argument" : "It is extremely important that the United States has secured borders to ensure the nation's national security. Restricting immigration creates a safer nation where legal citizens do not have to worry about their safety. There is already so many people living in the United States, more people entering our nation equals overpopulation which is not fair to the citizens already living here. It is absurd that someone who illegally immigrates to the United States receives the same benefits as a legal, working U.S. citizen. "
