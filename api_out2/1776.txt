	"argument" : "Religion plays a fairly important role in my life. I grew up going to church with my family and attending catholic schools. I have drifted away from the church a little bit, but still use a lot of the teachings in my everyday life to guide me in actions. My beliefs and past experiences have shaped me into who I am today and I am very thankful to have my faith. "
