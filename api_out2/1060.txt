	"argument" : "I enjoy listening to music and podcasts. I mainly listen to pop, rap, and indie music, so my favorite artists are Taylor Swift, Phoebe Bridgers, and Drake. My favorite food is a Caesar salad, but I also really enjoy the Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ben and Jerry's flavor. I spend a lot of my time catching up on 2000s TV shows on Netflix, FaceTiming friends, and reading fiction books. When I'm home over the summer, I love to explore the city of Charlotte and keep tabs with what is going on in the city, whether it is live Hornets games, concert performances, or social justice marches.
