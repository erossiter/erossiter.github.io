	"argument" : "Religion is the guiding factor for my daily life. I attempt to live my life following in the footsteps of the Lord. Everyone is human, and so people will make mistakes. Owning up to those mistakes in the eyes of God is what I believe makes you a better person. Devoting your time and energy into practicing prayer and teaching others is what inspires you to do good in all aspects of your life. It allows you to break away from Earthly materials and find peace in His grace. "
