	"argument" : "I am a born and bred Southern man. I enjoy barbeques, country music, and spending time with my family (which includes my best bud Spartacus). I believe everyone is created equal and that God intended for people to be in his image. I like hunting with my dad on the weekends, being outdoors, but I am always down for a night in as well."
