	"argument" : "I am most thankful for my family and their support for me. I was raised not only by two great parents but two god-fearing Christians, who taught me to always put God first. My brothers and I love to go fishing with my dad on Saturdays. My family is also very big on sports, growing up in a football town, I love watching the Super Bowl with my neighbors and friends. In fact I played football and baseball in high school. I also love driving in my F150 Ford truck, American trucks just run better. When I'm driving, I like to listen to country and folk. But I love the Christian radio. My mama would turn it on when she cooked. The whole house would smell so good when it was supper time, especially when she used her crockpot to make stews. But my favorite is her chicken pot pie."
