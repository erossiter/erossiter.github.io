Especially for people who just like to hunt, that would suck. My dad likes to hunt, but he would never hurt anyone with his gun. Mostly I think we just need to be careful and for school shootings and stuff, we should give those places more security because school shootings are bad and I don't want them to keep happening, but not everyone that has a gun is evil.
