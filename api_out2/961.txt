	"argument" : "In my free time, I enjoy worshipping my idols Donald Trump and Ronald Reagan. I enjoy long walks on my rural farm, and shooting the piss out of every aspect of wildlife from ants to deer with my full-auto military-grade M16. I enjoy country music blasting from the cab of my F150 with a 2-foot lift kit, especially while smoking a fine Black and Mild with a fat white woman in the front seat. My favorite foods are deep-fried liberal tears and licking the warm bottom of a boot. "
