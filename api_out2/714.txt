	"argument" : "I get why some people think we need them but I don't think they would be effective. People will find a way to get guns no matter what. Also guns are important for people and these laws would be harmful for them. Lots of my friends enjoy hunting or like to have guns for personal protection. I don't think that it would be fair that these people have to suffer because of the bad actions of others. Guns don't seem like they're the problem it's the people who misuse them."
