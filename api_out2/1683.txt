	"argument" : "I believe that many orginised religions were created to control groups of people. I also believe there is a higher power os some sort and there are diffrent ways to communicate and connect with this power. Weather it's through natural physical methods or prayer and devotion. I guess I would be considered religious but not because I spend time in church."
