	"argument" : "So far, the current administration has provided a sub-par performance. Coming from the last administration and the crisis that unfolded, he has been a breath of fresh air. I have been optimistic during his time in office because I genuinely like Joe as a person. I also was thrilled to see Kamala in office as the first black, female VP, but I feel that there have not been more initiatives to reflect the progress made within this administration. President Biden has just been met with barriers to nearly all of his legislative initiatives. An aspect I have been thrilled about is his ability to forgive debt from student loans. This has been a long-standing issue that has needed guidance because many young people are left at a disadvantage going into the real world, post-grad. I hope he can accomplish more in the second half of his term. "
