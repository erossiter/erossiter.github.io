	"argument" : "I'm from New York, New York and I recently moved to the south for my undergraduate degree. In my free time, I like to read often, find new music and check social media for news updates. My favorite artists at the moment are Taylor Swift, Lumineers, and Hozier. I love to travel but I usually only do so with a group of my friends or well-known people. "
