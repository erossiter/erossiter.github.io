	"argument" : "I would like to put out there that I do not have anything against foreigners. I do not think putting up a wall is an effective strategy for immigration control. But a huge influx of immigrants should be prevented. I do not think we have the capacities for many more people, especially in terms of jobs and thus I think the American population should be the priority before we help foreigners. There needs to be stricter control especially on illegal immigration. "
