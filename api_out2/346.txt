	"argument" : "I don't like how his policies are not putting working-class people first. Specifically, I didn't like his reaction to the Russia-Ukraine crisis. Gas prices went up by an amount I think was uncalled for and I can't be convinced that that didn't have to do directly with him being in office. His other policies aren't really helping those in the middle class, and he simply isn't mentally fit to be in office. I have tried to watch interviews with the guy and he will forget things that I don't really want a president to forget. He also I think has unfavorable views on what is written into the constitution, which is something I can't get behind. I am a firm believer in the constitution and I don't think certain things are up to interpretation."
