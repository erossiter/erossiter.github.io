	"argument" : "Religion plays a very large part in my life. I consider myself a man of God who believes that the Bible is the book written by God's disciples to lead us to a positive way of living. I tend to look towards my religious values when making political decisions as being a strong Christian leads me to focus on more issues like abortion. I believe that life begins at conception and that anyone that gets an abortion is committing murder as that baby is a human life created by Jesus Christ himself. EXODUS 20:13"
