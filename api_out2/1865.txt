	"argument" : "Religion is something that is very important to me. I believe that we need to honor our God in everything we do. While, I'm not perfect I believe that I can do better each and every day. I got to church on Sundays, bible study on Wednesdays, and every night I read my Bible and say my prayers. I thank the lord for all of my blessings, and I know that with Him I can do all things. I try to apply my religious beliefs in various aspects of my life like work, family, opinions, and more."
