	"argument" : "President Biden has been just another sub-par president. His presence is severely lacking, and he has no faithful following. Can you name one person who actually cares or is happy that he is the president? Does literally anyone want him to run for re-election? Biden has had no significant victories for the U.S. since he began his presidency, and all we see of him are his funny low-lights and terribly articulated speeches. "
