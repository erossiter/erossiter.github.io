	"argument" : "In the United States Constitution, the second amendment was created to protect citizens from each other, as well as from a government that accumulates too much power. The problem behind guns and the shootings that have occurred recently revolves around the idea that mental health is not addressed, rather than the issue being the ownership of guns itself. Stricter gun laws should be enforced to ensure that those purchasing weapons are mentally able and prepared. However, to take away guns is simply creating a band-aid solution to a problem that is much deeper-rooted, similar to the concept of drugs. Many drugs in the United States are illegal, such as cocaine, many hallucinogenic drugs, etc. However, people that desperately seek them out to purchase find a way to attain them, regardless of its illegality. If guns were outlawed, the people that would find a way to purchase them would be those we did not want to attain them."
