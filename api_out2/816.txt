	"argument" : "I love the outdoors and spending time in nature. I go backpacking and hiking in our beautiful national and state parks. I love to read, especially when its cold outside and I'm warm and cozy inside. I mostly read fiction books, but I try to read non-fiction books that challenge my preconceptions from time to time. I spend a bit too much time on social media, mostly Instagram and twitter, but that's where I get my news to stay up to date on current events."
