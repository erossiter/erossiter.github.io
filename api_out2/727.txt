	"argument" : "Gun control is simply just ineffective. No gun law is going to stop someone from getting a gun so regulating them with higher laws is not going to do anything. According to the United States constitution, I am free and can do what I please. This should mean I can buy and use what I please, and if that's a gun so be it. My dad was a hunter, and took my brothers out hunting all the time during the summer. I would go with them because my parents were divorced and it was good to spend time with my dad. Most guns are used for recreational purposes or for protection. I should be able to defend myself especially in times like these being a single young female. "
