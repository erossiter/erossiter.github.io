	"argument" : "The right to bear arms is written in the second amendment. If it wasn't important for an American to have the right to protect their family's, it wouldn't have been so high ranked. Because of that I think gun control laws are dumb and unnecessary. For the longest time, America has run on the honor system and it works. There is no need for the government to intervene in what the people do. They can't tell us what to do."
