	"argument" : "The best policy for the United States to take in regard to immigration is an open border or some form of a more open policy. Immigrants in this country are an essential part of American culture and history. The culture that is brought here by immigrants serves to enhance all aspects of America. Allowing immigrants into the country will allow us to grow as a society and bring enriching perspectives. Along with this, it will provide a safe haven for refugees abroad. It is our humanitarian responsibility to accept these people in need."
