	"argument" : "The United States is a country that has always been made up of immigrants, and so I feel it is only natural that the U.S. allows others to take part in the American dream. I also believe that all creating less restrictive immigration requirements would deter people from entering illegally. Moreover, countries should seek to bring in more talented individuals who can contribute to their society, and allowing more immigrants to enter the U.S. accomplishes this.  "
