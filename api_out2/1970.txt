	"argument" : "I would say that me being a Christian is very important to my life. It affects very part of my being as I do all this through Christ who strengthens me. My religion plays an important part to my politics, because it tells me what is wrong and what is right. The one true law behind all of the politics and news and government is the law of God, so if it were to offend him it would offend me and I strive to live a godly life. I associate myself with other believers and I do my best to avoid sin, because in the end Christ is my redeemer and the material things of this life will fade away. "
