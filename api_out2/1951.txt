	"argument" : "Religion is very important to me, because I consider my personal relationship with God to be a foundational part of who I am how I live my life. My faith teaches me that I should value all people, even if I disagree with them, and instructs me in my relationships with others. Knowing God and Jesus Christ means that I know what my life will look like, and that my soul is eternal, and I hope that more people will be able to have this as well."
