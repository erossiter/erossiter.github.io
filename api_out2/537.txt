	"argument" : "There should not be gun control, the problem is not the guns it is the people who carry them. I think it's ridiculous to see liberals pushing to take away weapons out of the hands of proud Americans. I understand maybe doing a background check, in some cases but I mean seriously, the founding fathers who built this country would be enraged to see what it is like to live here today. Guns are a right, and until the constitution says otherwise regulation should be little to none."
