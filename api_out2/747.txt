	"argument" : "Growing up one of my favorite activities was going hunting on early Sunday morning with my dad (only when my mother allowed us to miss church). Throughout all of this, my father taught me the importance of gun safety and how to use them. I feel stricter gun laws would infringe on our 2nd amendment right. I do agree gun safety should be taught more but overall, I think the way things are now work just fine."
