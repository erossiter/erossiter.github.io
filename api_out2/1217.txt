	"argument" : "Right now, I feel like immigration policy in the US is a train wreck, especially after Trump. The whole Let's build a wall to keep the illegals out! rhetoric on top of his blatant racism and xenophobia made everything 1000x worse. Personally, I think that there should be security at the borders simply because of national security concerns, but I don't believe in concentrating troops at the southern border to assault, harass, and split people from their families when they're just trying to start a new life. Generally, I feel that Biden is better than Trump, but there is still much to be done and we as a society shouldn't stop fighting for the betterment of others no matter how long it takes. "
