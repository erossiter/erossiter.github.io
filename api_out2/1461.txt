	"argument" : "Our open borders are overwhelming border states. While not all illegal immigrants are criminals, many drug smugglers and human traffickers are entering this country with no documentation. So many people have spent so much time and effort to become legal citizens in the United States. It is not fair for people to just enter the country without any process. I am not against immigrants coming to the United States but would like to see better policies in place for the safety of the immigrants and Americans. "
