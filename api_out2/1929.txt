	"argument" : "Religion plays a large role in my life. I am a Christian and I believe in Christian values. I believe God has a plan for all of us and that his command is the highest command. Honoring God in what I do on a daily basis is an honor and a goal that I willingly participate in. My faith has shaped how I see the world and how I interact with others around me."
