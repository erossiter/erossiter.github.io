	"argument" : "I enjoy spending time with my family. We love to do some outside activities and really be present in this beautiful world that God has created. I love listening to country music because the lyrics tell a narrative that makes me feel at peace with my life and my journey. I feel so blessed and comfortable with my family life and my beliefs in life because I know I am safe and there is a plan for me. God bless America."
