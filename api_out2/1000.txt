	"argument" : "In my free time, I usually post things on social media that support better climate change control. I spend a ton of time researching this because I believe it is the leading problem in our world today, and it is becoming increasingly important that we deal with it as life goes on. Because of this, i am a strict vegan and have not eaten any animal products since 2010."
