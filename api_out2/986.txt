	"argument" : "I love reading a wide variety of literature from classics to new novels by debut authors.  I believe that reading allows me to learn more about other cultures in a way that is wholesome and allows me to be more open minded.  I also love trying new foods especially from different cultures.  Although it's really spicy, I enjoy Indian cuisine and other South Asian cuisines."
