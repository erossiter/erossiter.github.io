	"argument" : "First off, I am a big fan of football and baseball. My favorite to play would have to be baseball, and football is the best sport to watch. Another fun fact is that I love rap music and country music. My favorite artists are probably Juice WLRD and Morgan Wallen, but I mostly listen to older country music. My favorite song is Ol' Red by Blake Shelton. "
