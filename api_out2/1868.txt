	"argument" : "Religion is apart of my life but does not play a huge role. I grew up in a very religious family but I have not continued practicing my religion as much as I used to. I would consider myself more spiritual than religious. I don't necessarily believe in every part of religion, but I am open to what others believe and will not judge them based on their religion. "
