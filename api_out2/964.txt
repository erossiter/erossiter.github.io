	"argument" : "I‘m from a suburban town where I go visit on weekends to catch up with high school friends and see my family. I really miss my mom’s cooking at school and go crazy for the homestyle meals she always has for family dinner. Usually my friends and I hang around or drive down the highway blasting music and end the night out by the water listening to country."
