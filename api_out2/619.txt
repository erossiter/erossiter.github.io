	"argument" : "Personally, I think there should be more gun control laws in the United States. The laws we have right now simply do not protect people like they are supposed to. Too many people who have terrible intentions have been able to purchase a gun and hurt people. If we were to employ more strict gun laws, like there being thorough background checks and a mental health evaluation, then less people would die or suffer at the hands of guns. "
