	"argument" : "President Biden has not done a good job in office at all. The gas prices are way too high, he had an ugly take on ending the Afghanistan war, and he is just simply too old to be in office. Biden's had supported conservatives in the past, I feel like he has betrayed the Republican Party. His opinion on Roe v. Wade is what really aggravates me, abortion is murder and Biden does not think so. "
