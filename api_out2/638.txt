	"argument" : "I believe that gun control laws would be very affective. For example, in the light of school shootings being at an all time high, there is no excuse to not have gun control laws. There is no reason that an average individual should have access to an assault rifle. A child should not have to fear for their life as they go to school, a place that is supposed to be safe. Instead of offering thoughts and prayers, this country needs action and change. "
