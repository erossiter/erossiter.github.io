	"argument" : "I believe in helping those who need help therefore, the United States should allow immigration. Those who wish to build a wall, are quite frankly selfish. The current immigration policy is lacking, the United States should do more to help open up the border and minimize backlash against immigrants. Families are being split apart and many innocent lives are being lost. It is inhumane and cruel to not allow immigrants an opportunity to pursue a better life. "
