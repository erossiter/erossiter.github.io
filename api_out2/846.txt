	"argument" : "My name is Yoni and I am a student at UNC-Chapel Hill. My hobbies include reading and volunteering at my local soup kitchen. I am very dedicated to making sure the needs of those around me are met, and in that way, I consider myself an activist. I also enjoy listening to music from a wide variety of genres, from alternative to hip-hop to R&B. My favorite artist at the moment is probably John Legend, who I admire for his commitment to his music as well as to prominent political causes. My favorite food is either pasta or quesadillas."
