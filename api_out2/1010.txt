	"argument" : "For my hobbies, I enjoy tennis, reading, trying out new coffee shops, and hanging out with my friends. I enjoy primarily indie and pop music, but I am willing to listen to just about anything (except most country music). I especially like Taylor Swift and The Lumineers. My favorite food is probably acai bowls (I make them myself). I do not really like most meats, but any type of seafood is the best. My favorite TV show is New Girl, but I am always down to watch a good anime. "
