	"argument" : "In my free time, I love to go on hikes and drink coffee and spend time with my friends, family, and pet. I enjoy watching movies and tv shows and I am always down for a new adventure. I love listening to Taylor Swift and my favorite food is watermelon. I enjoy trying new restaurants and reading in my hammock as well."
