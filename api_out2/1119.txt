	"argument" : "I am a seventh generation student at UNC. I have grown up going to football games at Chapel Hill. I am on club tennis. I am from Wilmington and live on the water. My dad and I like to go clamming and fishing in the marsh. My brother goes to all boys boarding school in Virginia. He plays tennis and golf. Last summer I worked at a marina. I enjoy folk country music like the band Caamp."
