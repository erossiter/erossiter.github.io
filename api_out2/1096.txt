	"argument" : "I'm a second-year college student, which does not allow for much free time. However, when I do have free time, I love to get involved in as many campus organizations as possible. There are so many organizations here that are trying to make a real change. I enjoy listening to music with friends and going out to eat. We mainly listen to Taylor Swift and various alternative artists. As far as favorite restaurants, I'm vegan so I'll eat anywhere I can get a salad."
