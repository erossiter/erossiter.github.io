	"argument" : "Religion is not an important factor in my life, but I never let it cloud my judgement of others. I know how fundamental religion can be to some people and I think it is important that all religious beliefs are valued and given a space to be practiced safely. Additionally, I think it is extremely important to separate the church and state. Laws should not be made and enforced based on one particular religious view (i.e. Abortion) when we are a nation made of very different beliefs. "
