	"argument" : "I like to read and I'm an avid movie watcher/critic. My dad and I like to watch foreign films together and talk about them, our favorite is Tell No One. I like to volunteer at the local homeless shelter every Sunday. There are many staying people there who look forward to me coming and we have become close. I enjoy lots of music but typically Taylor Swift and The Chicks other powerful women artists that fight for equality. "
