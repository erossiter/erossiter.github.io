	"argument" : "Biden's performance has been a complete joke, and the entire world knows it. His inability to act as a firm president has allowed for many atrocities in the last almost two years. His disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal was one of the first ways he made horrible-rippling decisions. A US drone strike targeting ISIS fighters was a mistake as it killed 10 innocent people, including seven children. There is no way of coming back from this, he obliterated his competency thesis. He has also told stories that aren't true, such as claiming to have been arrested in the civil rights movement, driven a tractor-trailer, and intervened in Israel's six-day war. In the september meeting with Senators, he referred to himself as one of their colleagues before correcting himself. He ahs just shown himself to be incapable of living alone, let alone the role of President leading the United States."
