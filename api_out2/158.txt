	"argument" : "The 2020 election was a battle of two evils. while neither option was good, I think Bidens presidency is a disgrace to Americans.  Biden has demonstrated his leniency by allowing capital drug offenders out of jail. he has also caused an increase in gas prices which is damaging to the American economy.
