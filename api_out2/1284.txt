	"argument" : "Immigration can be a good thing but in moderation. Yes, it would be great to welcome in immigrants, but it is an unachievable ideal. The reality is that the focus needs to be helping American citizens first and foremost and helping immigrants and the world community at the same time when possible. It would be great if we could provide all American citizens housing and jobs and also provide immigrants with the same but we can not continuously welcome immigrants in with open arms with no restraints or control.
