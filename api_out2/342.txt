	"argument" : "President Biden has been one of the worst presidents in US history. His performance in Afghanistan has made the US an international laughing stock. Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is proof that the US isn’t taken seriously anymore. His environmental policies have also drastically increased gas prices, something Americans still recovering from the economic impact of Covid and a coming recession can’t handle. Biden is an establishment democrat who is a puppet of the far left, and an embarrassment to our national image."
