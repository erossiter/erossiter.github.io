	"argument" : "There has to be a change in the laws we have concerning gun control laws. There have been countless school shootings that have killed children and teachers alike. Teachers should not have to go into their first grade class each day and worry about a random disturbed man coming in and shooting up their entire classroom. Parents are grieving their previously healthy and happy children because of the relaxed gun laws of this country. There needs to be a change. It breaks my heart that this is our reality. We feed people the idea that we are a country of refuge and safety, when in reality no other country struggles with this issue. Anyone over the age of eighteen shouldn't be able to walk into a store and buy any gun they want. There needs to be more restrictions and bans of certain guns."
