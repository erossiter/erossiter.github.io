	"argument" : "I was surprised when I woke up and Biden had been elected. I am not a huge Trump fan, as many republicans would agree, but at least he can form coherent sentences. Biden rigged the election and that shows in how he is handling his presidency. Obama was fine but Biden seems to just talk to talk without any substance. He has not accomplished much and the economy is slipping with him as president. All i got to say is I hope when reelections come up, he loses. "
