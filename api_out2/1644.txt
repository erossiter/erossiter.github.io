	"argument" : "Although religion doesn't play a huge part in my life, it does have a small one. I believe in the morals of how to treat people kindly and many others such as that, but don't always agree with the traditional aspects of the church and the never changing religion. I think that religion should be accepting of all, and many are not as accepting as they should be. Again, I like the values that many religions teach people and how they help bring kind people into the world, but it can also bring people who do not accept change, therefore religion plays the role of promoting positive values in my life but not my all-in-all beliefs.
