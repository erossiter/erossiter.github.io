	"argument" : "The second amendment should be protected and is not up for reinterpretation. It should be taken at face value as was written by our founding father's, not reevaluated to further the agenda of our current culture. Our current laws regarding gun control are sufficient and are not the problem. We have a mental health crisis in America that accounts for increasing gun violence yet the violence is being used as a ploy by liberals to push for more gun control."
