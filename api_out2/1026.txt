	"argument" : "I like to be outside, especially going hiking and on runs. I like to read, watch movies and listen to music. I especially enjoy classic, alt-indie music and watching Oscar-winning dramas. I like to try new foods and cuisines as much as I can. I enjoy meeting new people, and learning from others with new perspective and from different cultures. I would love to travel around the world and look at art."
