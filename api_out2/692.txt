	"argument" : "In theory, the second amendment guarantees the right to obtain firearm.  Gun control laws are only taking that constitutional right away, which is a violation of our freedom as Americans.  Gun control is not going to fix the problem, but rather just strip our sense of self-defense.  Criminals will still be able to buy guns illegally, leaving ordinary citizens essentially defenseless."
