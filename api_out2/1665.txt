	"argument" : "Religion is a fundamental aspect of life. It is foundation block of my worldview. I  pray regularly, go to Church on regular basis, and attempt to apply the natural law, an important part of Christian ethics, to every facet of my life. Religion is an cornerstone of my politics as well. One essential pillar of Conservatism is a belief in a transcendent moral order. I apply the natural law to all parts of politics. For example, I do not believe that people should be allowed to kill themselves because God does not purpose man to take his own life and therefore suicide, even doctor assisted suicide, is wrong. Thus, religion forms my worldview which affects all parts of my life. "
