	"argument" : "Religion plays a huge role in my life. I  am Christian, and my faith is one of the most important aspects of my life and my family member's lives. I have attended church my whole life, and I plan on raising my own children in the same denomination that I was raised. I am extremely grateful to say that align with Christianity and hope to pass the word of God onto everyone in my life."
