	"argument" : "I’m from the mountains of North Carolina, and I’m an only child. My mom’s side of the family is from rural South Carolina. I grew up riding horses, playing multiple instruments, and getting into a lot of trouble with my cousins (my grandma had ten kids). Now, I enjoy cooking/baking, spending time with my dog, and gardening. My favorite thing to eat is a grilled ribeye with a baked potato and sweat tea to drink. "
