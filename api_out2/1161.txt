	"argument" : "I grew up in rural New York before moving to North Carolina. I enjoy fishing and hiking with my dogs, and I spend most Sundays watching football.  My grandfather taught me how to hunt when I was in middle school; he used to take me deer hunting with him when I visited his house in New York. Although I don't hunt much anymore after his passing, I still enjoy it. I listen to a number of artists, but my favorites are George Strait and Dylan Schneider. My favorite food is definitely eastern style pulled pork. "
