	"argument" : "I don't understand why someone would protect gun control rights over the safety of our own country. I understand constitutional rights and everything but the Constitution was written centuries ago, they had no idea how guns were going to evolve. There is no reason why anyone needs to own an assault rifle, there is no reason. We should restrict what types of guns can be bought and sold and increase background checks. We need more gun control laws. "
