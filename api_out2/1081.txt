	"argument" : "A bit more about myself is both of my parents went to school at UNC. I love to watch sports and read. I also love to play the guitar. My friends and I in high school always used to talk about starting a band one day. I have played the guitar, the French horn, the piano, and the saxophone throughout my life, but I still love all kinds of music. My favorite two music types would probably be indie rock and 80s music. My favorite food is probably chicken although I have a really big, sweet tooth for chocolate."
