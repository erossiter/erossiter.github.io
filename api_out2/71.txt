	"argument" : "President Biden's current performance has been applaudable but still imperfect. I commend his administration's focus on promoting a sustainable future for America through reliance on green energy to combat climate change. His recent student loan forgiveness initiative is also praiseworthy, as it will provide enormous relief to low-income households struggling to manage student debt. Finally, I support President Biden's commitment to the success of Ukraine and its people through financial aid packages. Biden's handling of the border crisis has been troublesome, however, since he has failed to fulfill his campaign promises of ending the Remain in Mexico policy and the conditions at the housing facilities remain in need of improvement. I also do not support his handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, since the sudden removal of troops allowed the Taliban to regain control of the country and commit atrocities against those we were defending."
