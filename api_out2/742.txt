	"argument" : "I believe that the second amendment is incredibly important. It is the second most important amendment in my opinion, and it is the only reason we have not been overtaken by larger powers. A leader in China for example, if I am remembering correctly, once said that the only reason they would never take over the US is because there is a firearm behind every blade of grass. I think everyone should have access to guns with the exception of those who have committed violent crimes and those who are a risk to themselves or others. I also think it is important that we as citizens defend our right to bear arms so that we can defend against our own government if needed. A citizen militia is important for the safety of the American people. In terms of gun control, I think we don't need any more, if not, less than we do now. I don't like the recent threats to ban suppressors, and I worry about it becoming federal law. I honestly think it would be unconstitutional to have more gun control."
