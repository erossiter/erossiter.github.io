	"argument" : "Religion is one of the biggest values I hold in my life. I have been both baptized and confirmed through my church, First Presbyterian. I feel like having a God figure in your life is important to get you through hard times. Having someone like God to lean on during tough times is important for your overall being. Ever since I was young I remember loving church, I made friends that had to same beliefs as me, it made me feel loved by the grace of God. "
