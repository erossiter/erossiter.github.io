	"argument" : "Well, it is a constitutional right to bare arms. And imma carry mine locked and loaded. The problem is not controlling guns. If folks wanna kill people they gonna do it by any means necessary. And that’s just logic. The left always tryna push an agenda about gun laws when it won’t stop mass shootings. Just like illegal drugs are pushed into America so will guns if they become banned too. But that banned better come after I take my last breath because imma be raising hell if I’m here to see it. "
