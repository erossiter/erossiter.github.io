	"argument" : "This country was built on immigration so I don't understand why people think immigrants are here to steal jobs. This country promises freedom and equality so why are people so quick to hate and restrict people? I think there should be an organizes system in place for allowing immigrants to become part of this country but it shouldn't be separating kids from their parents or stupid expensive to get paperwork and lawyers nor should it leave people so desperate to enter the country that they will risk their lives to cross the border"
