I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science and an A.M. in Statistics student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington University in St. Louis.  I broadly study political methodology, American political behavior, and political communication.  You can find my CV [here](cv.html).

My dissertation evaluates how everyday conversations across party lines might reinforce or mitigate the animosity partisans hold toward members of the opposite political party.  To study these questions, I apply and develop text as data and experimental methods suited for studying social interaction.  This work is funded by a National Science Foundation Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grant.
