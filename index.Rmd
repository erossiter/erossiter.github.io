I am the Nancy Reeves Dreux Assistant Professor of Political Science at University of Notre Dame. I study interpersonal
communication and its political consequences, with a specific interest in political discussion and polarization. My research agenda equally involves advancing quantitative methodologies, namely experimental design and
text-as-data methods, suited for the complexities inherent in interpersonal communications. My work has been supported by two grants from the National Science Foundation and is published in the *The American Journal of Political Science,* *The Journal of Politics,* and other outlets.

Before coming to Notre Dame, I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from Washington University in St. Louis in 2021 and a B.A. in Political Science & English from Creighton University in 2015.
