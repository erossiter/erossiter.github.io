I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science and an A.M. in Statistics student in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at Washington University in St. Louis.  I broadly study political methodology, American political behavior, and political communication.  My dissertation evaluates how everyday conversations across party lines might reinforce or mitigate the animosity partisans hold toward members of the opposite political party.  To study these questions, I apply and develop text as data and experimental methods suited for studying social interaction.
